# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Overview  
This project focuses on understanding and predicting customer churn using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. The analysis identifies key factors contributing to churn and develops predictive models to support strategic decision-making aimed at customer retention.

## Key Components  

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Performed rigorous data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.  
- Conducted detailed exploratory analysis to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in customer behavior.  
- Created visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to communicate insights effectively.  

### 2. **Feature Engineering**  
- Engineered meaningful features to capture customer engagement, demographics, and product usage.  
- Scaled and transformed variables to prepare data for model training.  

### 3. **Predictive Modeling**  
- Built machine learning models, including logistic regression, to predict churn with high accuracy.  
- Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.  

### 4. **Insights and Recommendations**  
- A main portion of churn for Telco are from customers that use Fiber-Optic internet. The underlying reasons seem to due with security and tech support. This is something the company can address by implementing a specific number for tech support that are only for Fiber-Optic customers. This can be viable since customers pay the most for Fiber Optic service. Furthermore, Telco should look into increase and strengthing their security measures as well. 
  
## Tools and Technologies  
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks  
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassanelfattmi/why-do-customers-leave-can-you-spot-the-churners

## Results  
Achieved a significant improvement in predictive accuracy, enabling data-driven strategies to mitigate churn and enhance customer retention.
